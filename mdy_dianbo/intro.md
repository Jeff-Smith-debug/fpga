The best way to master fpga is to do practical project;
Study ways:First whole then local.

## 1.1 Problem-1:learn verilog with software thought.
1.Takes some months to look book with the programmer of verilog.
You should know the 90% of verilog is used in simulation testbench.
The design program of verilog is very simple key words.
2.Use verilog with C-lanuage.
you should know the verilog is hardware description lanuage,rather than execute language. You should clear know the circults or the behaviour the rtl.
you can master verilog programmer with 1 hour.

3.Pursit the achieve of function.
You should know that 20% of time spent in rtl meet,but 80% of rtl spent quality.
Eg: Traffic lights lab: from easy to hard gradually.

No confusing: combination circuit use "=";timing circuit use "<=";
When design RTL to achieve function: you should take care the hardware thinking and the software thinking;
